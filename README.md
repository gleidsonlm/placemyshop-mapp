# Project Name: placemyshop

## Introduction

Welcome to `placemyshop`! This is a multi-device application built using React Native (Expo) to help liberal professionals and SMB offices manage their online presence and client interactions.
It leverages an AI agentic architecture to deliver its core functionalities. Currently, the app is in its initial development phase, starting with core UI elements.

Our main features (Planned) include:
- Create a simple landing page with contact information, social media links, address, live chat, and contact form.
- Single place to publish social media content to all connected APIs.
- Omnichannel chat with supported social media platforms (starting with Meta: WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook).
- Manage online presence with Google Business Profile.
- Manage online presence with Meta for Business.

## Architectural Overview

`placemyshop` is built upon an **AI agentic software architecture**. This means the system is composed of multiple intelligent agents, each responsible for specific tasks and capable of communicating and collaborating to achieve complex goals. This approach allows for a modular, scalable, and adaptable system. The React Native (Expo) application serves as the user interface and interaction layer for this agentic system.

### Agentic Coding Paradigm

We embrace an agentic coding paradigm where individual components (agents) are designed to be:
- **Autonomous:** Capable of operating independently to fulfill their designated roles.
- **Reactive:** Able to perceive their environment (or internal system state) and respond to changes.
- **Proactive:** Taking initiative to achieve goals without direct external command for every action.
- **Communicative:** Interacting with other agents through well-defined protocols.

### AI Agent Orchestration

The orchestration of agents within `placemyshop` is inspired by concepts from Google Jules and other leading agent frameworks. This involves:
- **Task Decomposition:** Breaking down high-level goals into smaller, manageable tasks for individual agents.
- **Workflow Management:** Defining how agents collaborate and sequence their actions.
- **State Management:** Maintaining and sharing relevant state information across agents in a consistent manner.
- **Communication Protocols:** Establishing clear and efficient communication channels and message formats.

### Google Jules Influence

While `placemyshop` is a distinct project, we draw inspiration from the design principles and operational patterns of **Google Jules**. This includes:
- **Modular Agent Design:** Creating focused, single-responsibility agents.
- **Clear Interfaces:** Defining explicit contracts for agent inputs, outputs, and capabilities.
- **Tool Usage:** Equipping agents with necessary tools (internal or external) to perform their functions.
- **Planning and Execution:** Implementing mechanisms for agents to plan their actions and execute them, potentially adapting to new information.
- _Note: As Google Jules is an internal Google framework, specific implementation details are not publicly available. Our use of "Google Jules concepts" refers to publicly discussed principles of agentic design and best practices in building multi-agent systems._

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (e.g., LTS version)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI
- (Optional but recommended) Android Studio (for Android emulator/development)
- (Optional but recommended) Xcode (for iOS simulator/development, macOS only)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [**TODO: Repository URL**]
   cd placemyshop
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install # or yarn install
   ```
3. **Configuration:**
   (No specific Expo configuration needed for basic setup at this stage)

## How to Run the App

```bash
npx expo start # Starts the Metro bundler and shows options to run on different platforms
npx expo run:android # Runs on an Android emulator or connected device
npx expo run:ios # Runs on an iOS simulator or connected device (macOS only)
npx expo run:web # Runs in a web browser
```

## Security Threat Event Monitoring

The application includes a feature to monitor and display security threat events, enhancing its security posture. Initially, this focuses on events provided by Appdome.

### NetworkProxyConfigured Event

*   **Event:** `NetworkProxyConfigured`
*   **Description:** This event is triggered when the Appdome security layer detects that a remote proxy server has been configured on the device. This could indicate a potential Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack attempt, where an unauthorized party might try to intercept network traffic.
*   **UI Display:** Detected Network Proxy events are shown on the "Threat Events" screen. Each event card displays key details such as:
    *   Proxy Host
    *   Proxy Port
    *   Proxy Type
    *   Network Connection Type
    *   Application State at the time of detection
    *   Timestamp of the detection

This allows for awareness and potential logging of such security-sensitive occurrences.
