# Agents in placemyshop

This document outlines the planned AI agents that will form the core of the `placemyshop` application, enabling its key features for liberal professionals and SMB offices. This system is designed to be modular, with each agent handling specific responsibilities.

## Guiding Principles (Inspired by Google Jules)

The design and interaction of these agents will draw inspiration from principles associated with robust agentic systems like Google Jules:
- **Modularity & Single Responsibility:** Each agent has a clearly defined purpose.
- **Clear Interfaces:** Agents will communicate through well-defined inputs and outputs.
- **Tool Usage:** Agents will be equipped with the necessary tools (e.g., API clients, data processors) to perform their tasks.
- **Orchestration:** A dedicated agent will likely manage task decomposition and workflow between agents.

## Planned Core Agents

The following agents are envisioned to deliver the core functionality of `placemyshop`. More specialized agents may be introduced as the system evolves.

---

### 1. `LandingPageAgent`
*   **Feature Alignment:** (3a) Create a simple landing page.
*   **Description:** This agent will be responsible for generating and managing simple landing pages for users.
*   **Key Responsibilities (Planned):**
    *   Collect user information for the landing page (contact details, social media links, address).
    *   Allow users to choose from predefined templates.
    *   Generate static HTML/CSS or configure a simple CMS for the landing page.
    *   Manage content for the contact form and potentially a live chat widget.
*   **Potential Tools:** Template engines, static site generators, API clients for chat services.
*   **Interacts With (Planned):** `UserInterfaceAgent`, `MasterControlAgent`.

### 2. `SocialPublishingAgent`
*   **Feature Alignment:** (3b) Single place to publish social media content.
*   **Description:** This agent will handle the creation and distribution of content across various connected social media platforms.
*   **Key Responsibilities (Planned):**
    *   Provide an interface for users to compose posts (text, images, videos).
    *   Connect to social media APIs (e.g., Meta, X, LinkedIn) using user-provided credentials/tokens.
    *   Publish content to selected platforms simultaneously or on a schedule.
    *   Potentially track basic engagement metrics.
*   **Potential Tools:** API clients for each social media platform, scheduling libraries, image/video processing tools.
*   **Interacts With (Planned):** `UserInterfaceAgent`, `MasterControlAgent`.

### 3. `OmniChatAgent`
*   **Feature Alignment:** (3c) Omnichannel chat.
*   **Description:** This agent will aggregate messages from various connected social media platforms into a single interface and allow users to respond from one place.
*   **Key Responsibilities (Planned):**
    *   Integrate with messaging APIs of supported platforms (starting with Meta: WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook).
    *   Fetch incoming messages and display them in a unified inbox.
    *   Send outgoing messages through the respective platform APIs.
    *   Manage chat sessions and user identities across platforms where possible.
*   **Potential Tools:** Platform-specific messaging SDKs/APIs, real-time communication libraries (e.g., WebSockets if interfacing with the app).
*   **Interacts With (Planned):** `UserInterfaceAgent`, `MasterControlAgent`.

---

### 4. `GoogleBusinessAgent`
*   **Feature Alignment:** (3d) Manage Google Business Profile.
*   **Description:** This agent will assist users in managing their Google Business Profile information.
*   **Key Responsibilities (Planned):**
    *   Connect to the Google Business Profile API.
    *   Update business information (hours, address, services).
    *   Manage posts, photos, and Q&A.
    *   Monitor and respond to reviews.
*   **Potential Tools:** Google Business Profile API client.
*   **Interacts With (Planned):** `UserInterfaceAgent`, `MasterControlAgent`.

---

### 5. `MetaBusinessAgent`
*   **Feature Alignment:** (3e) Manage Meta for Business.
*   **Description:** This agent will assist users in managing their presence and activities on Meta's business platforms (Facebook Pages, Instagram Business).
*   **Key Responsibilities (Planned):**
    *   Connect to Meta's Graph API (and other relevant APIs).
    *   Manage page information, posts, and stories.
    *   Oversee ad campaigns (potentially in a simplified manner).
    *   View basic analytics.
*   **Potential Tools:** Meta Graph API client.
*   **Interacts With (Planned):** `UserInterfaceAgent`, `MasterControlAgent`.

---

### 6. `UserInterfaceAgent` (Conceptual)
*   **Description:** This conceptual agent (or set of services/modules) represents the bridge between the user-facing React Native application and the backend agentic system.
*   **Key Responsibilities (Planned):**
    *   Translate user actions from the mobile/web UI into tasks for the backend agents.
    *   Receive data and results from backend agents and format them for display in the UI.
    *   Handle user authentication and session management for agent interactions.
*   **Interacts With (Planned):** All feature-specific agents (via `MasterControlAgent`), React Native components.

---

### 7. `MasterControlAgent` (Orchestrator - Conceptual)
*   **Description:** This agent will oversee the overall workflow, task decomposition, and communication between the various specialized agents.
*   **Key Responsibilities (Planned):**
    *   Receive high-level requests originating from the `UserInterfaceAgent`.
    *   Determine which specialized agent(s) are needed for a task.
    *   Route requests and data between agents.
    *   Manage complex multi-agent workflows (e.g., publishing content and then updating a landing page).
    *   Handle errors and ensure tasks are completed.
*   **Interacts With (Planned):** All other agents.

## Agent Communication (Planned)

Agents will likely communicate via a combination of direct API calls (for tightly coupled interactions) and a message bus or event-driven architecture (for more decoupled workflows), orchestrated by the `MasterControlAgent`. Clear data contracts (e.g., using JSON schemas or similar) will be defined for messages.
