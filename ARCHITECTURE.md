# Architecture Documentation for placemyshop

This document provides a detailed overview of the software architecture for `placemyshop`. The system combines a user-facing application built with React Native (Expo) and a backend system powered by AI agents. The React Native app provides the UI/UX and client-side interaction logic, while the AI agents (detailed in `AGENTS.MD`) handle core business logic, external API integrations (e.g., social media, Google Business), and intelligent task execution.

## 1. Architecture Diagrams

_[**Placeholder**]_

This section will house visual representations of the system architecture. As the project evolves, we will add diagrams such as:

- **Overall System Diagram:** Showing the React Native app, the agentic backend, external services (Google, Meta), data stores, and their high-level interactions.
- **Frontend Architecture:** Illustrating the component hierarchy, navigation flow (e.g., using React Navigation), and state management strategy within the React Native (Expo) application.
- **Backend Agentic Architecture:** Visualizing how the core agents (defined in `AGENTS.MD`) interact, the role of the `MasterControlAgent`, and message/data flow patterns.
- **Sequence Diagrams:** For key features, detailing interactions. Examples:
    - "Publishing a Social Media Post": UI -> `UserInterfaceAgent` -> `MasterControlAgent` -> `SocialPublishingAgent` -> External Social Media API.
    - "Handling an Incoming Chat Message": External Chat Platform -> `OmniChatAgent` (via webhook/polling) -> `MasterControlAgent` -> `UserInterfaceAgent` -> UI.
- **Flowcharts:** Visualizing complex decision-making processes within individual agents or the orchestration logic.

*(These diagrams will be created using a consistent tool/format, to be decided by the team, e.g., PlantUML, Lucidchart, or draw.io).*

## 2. Shared Abstractions, Patterns, and Protocols

This section describes common elements ensuring consistency and interoperability.

### 2.1. Frontend (React Native / Expo)

- **Core Abstractions:**
    - **React Components:** Building blocks of the UI, following a component-based architecture.
    - **React Hooks:** For stateful logic and side effects within functional components.
    - **Expo SDK Modules:** Leveraging Expo's APIs for device capabilities and simplified development workflows (e.g., camera, file system, notifications).
- **State Management:**
    - [**TODO: Define specific strategy, e.g., React Context for simple state, `useState`/`useReducer` for local component state. Consider libraries like Redux Toolkit or Zustand if global state complexity grows.**]
- **Navigation:**
    - Likely using **React Navigation** for managing screens and navigation flows within the app (stack, tab, drawer navigators).
- **Communication with Backend:**
    - The React Native app will primarily communicate with the `UserInterfaceAgent` (or an API Gateway fronting it).
    - [**TODO: Define primary protocol, e.g., HTTPS-based RESTful APIs, GraphQL, or WebSockets for real-time features like chat.**] Authentication will be handled via tokens (e.g., JWT).

### 2.2. Backend (AI Agentic System)

This system, inspired by principles from Google Jules, focuses on modular, autonomous agents.

- **Core Agent Abstraction:**
    - **Base Agent Class/Interface:** [**TODO: Define a common structure or interface for agents, potentially including methods like `handle_task(task_description)` and `get_status()`.**]
    - **Lifecycle Management:** [**TODO: How are agents instantiated, configured, started, monitored, and stopped? This might be managed by the `MasterControlAgent` or a dedicated service.**]
- **Communication Protocols (Inter-Agent):**
    - **Message Format:** Standardized JSON for message payloads, potentially with defined schemas (e.g., JSON Schema) for validation and clarity.
    - **Communication Channels:**
        - [**TODO: Decide on primary mechanism: e.g., a message bus (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Streams) for asynchronous, decoupled communication, especially for tasks handled by the `MasterControlAgent`. Direct internal API calls (e.g., gRPC or REST) might be used for tightly coupled, synchronous interactions if necessary.**]
    - **Error Handling:** Agents should report errors back to the orchestrator (`MasterControlAgent`). Standardized error codes and messages will be used. Retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues (if using a message bus) will be considered.
- **State Management (Agents):**
    - **Shared State:** [**TODO: If critical shared state is needed between agents (e.g., user profiles, API tokens), a distributed cache (Redis) or a database might be used. The `MasterControlAgent` might be responsible for managing access to some shared resources.**]
    - **Agent-Specific State:** Individual agents may maintain their own internal state, persisted as needed (e.g., in-memory for short-lived tasks, or a database for long-term state).
- **Common Design Patterns (Agents):**
    - **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each agent has a focused set of tasks.
    - **Event-Driven Architecture:** Agents react to events or messages.
    - **Strategy Pattern:** For different ways an agent might accomplish a task (e.g., different publishing strategies for the `SocialPublishingAgent`).
    - **Circuit Breaker:** For interactions with external APIs to prevent cascading failures.
- **Communication with Frontend (via `UserInterfaceAgent`):**
    - The `UserInterfaceAgent` acts as the primary bridge to the frontend. It will expose a well-defined API (matching the frontend's communication choice, e.g., REST endpoints).
    - It translates frontend requests into the internal agent message format and tasks for the `MasterControlAgent`.
    - It receives results from agents, formats them, and sends them back to the frontend.

## 3. Interfaces and Contract Points

This section defines key interfaces enabling modularity.

### 3.1. Frontend-Backend Interface
- This is the API exposed by the `UserInterfaceAgent` (or an API Gateway) to the React Native application.
- **Examples (Conceptual REST Endpoints):**
    - `POST /api/v1/landingpage/create`: Initiates landing page creation. Body contains user preferences.
    - `POST /api/v1/social/publish`: Publishes a post. Body includes content and target platforms.
    - `GET /api/v1/chat/messages`: Fetches aggregated chat messages.
    - `POST /api/v1/chat/send`: Sends a chat message.
    - `PUT /api/v1/gbp/profile`: Updates Google Business Profile.
- [**TODO: Formalize this API using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications as it's defined.**]

### 3.2. Inter-Agent Interfaces (Backend)
- These are the "service interfaces" for each specialized agent, invoked by the `MasterControlAgent` (or sometimes directly by other agents if appropriate).
- **Example: `SocialPublishingAgent`**
    - **Method/Task:** `publish_post(user_id, platform_targets, content_data)`
    - **Input:** User ID, list of platforms (e.g., "facebook", "instagram"), structured content (text, image URLs).
    - **Output:** Status of publication for each platform (e.g., success, failure, post ID).
    - **Description:** This task instructs the agent to publish the provided content to the specified social media platforms for the given user.

### 3.3. External API Interfaces
- Agents like `SocialPublishingAgent`, `GoogleBusinessAgent`, `MetaBusinessAgent`, and `OmniChatAgent` will interact with external third-party APIs (e.g., Meta Graph API, Google Business Profile API, WhatsApp Business API).
- The contracts for these interfaces are defined by the respective external providers. Agents will encapsulate the logic for these interactions, including authentication, request formatting, and error handling.

## 4. Extending the Architecture

Adding new features typically involves modifications across both frontend and backend:

**Example: Adding a new social media integration (e.g., "LinkedIn Publishing")**
1.  **Backend:**
    *   Define a new agent (e.g., `LinkedInPublishingAgent`) responsible for LinkedIn API interactions.
    *   Implement this agent, adhering to the Core Agent Abstraction, equipping it with a LinkedIn API client tool.
    *   Update the `MasterControlAgent` to recognize and route tasks to `LinkedInPublishingAgent`.
    *   Update the `UserInterfaceAgent` to expose a new endpoint or modify an existing one for LinkedIn publishing.
2.  **Frontend (React Native App):**
    *   Add UI elements (e.g., a "Publish to LinkedIn" checkbox or button).
    *   Implement client-side logic to call the new/updated API endpoint exposed by the `UserInterfaceAgent`.
    *   Update state management and display logic to handle LinkedIn-specific responses or data.
3.  **Documentation:** Update `AGENTS.MD` and relevant sections of this `ARCHITECTURE.MD`.
4.  **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests for the new agent, API endpoints, and UI components.
